## 1. BUGS — Factual errors that must be fixed

### BUG-1: Ch02 illustration — pixel row 109 should be 107
- **Chapter:** Ch02 (Screen as Puzzle)
- **File:** `/Users/alice/dev/antique-toy/illustrations/scripts/ch02_screen_layout.py`, line 404
- **Description:** The worked example in `ch02_screen_layout.png` says "pixel row 109" for address `$4BAA` (third 1, row 5, line 3). Correct value is **107**: `64 + 5*8 + 3 = 107`. The address bits (TT=01, SSS=011, LLL=101) are correct; only the final pixel row number is wrong.
- **Fix:** Change `"pixel row 109"` to `"pixel row 107"` in the Python script and regenerate the PNG/SVG.
- **Source:** Rombor (via Aki, SinDiKat Slack)
- **Priority:** P1

### BUG-2: Ch11 — AY was not implemented by Amstrad
- **Chapter:** Ch11 (Sound Architecture)
- **File:** `/Users/alice/dev/antique-toy/chapters/ch11-sound/draft.md`, line 7
- **Description:** Current text says "By the time Amstrad put it into the Spectrum 128K in 1986." This is historically inaccurate. The AY was first integrated into the ZX Spectrum by **Investronica** (not "Inverstronica") in the Spanish Spectrum 128K, which Sinclair then adopted. Amstrad came later with the +2/+3. The sentence conflates Amstrad with the 128K, which was a Sinclair product (based on the Spanish design).
- **Fix:** Rewrite to credit Investronica/Sinclair for the 128K, and clarify Amstrad's role (+2/+3 only).

- **Priority:** P1

### BUG-3: Ch11 — AY chip variant in the Spectrum is 8912, not 8910
- **Chapter:** Ch11 (Sound Architecture)
- **File:** `/Users/alice/dev/antique-toy/chapters/ch11-sound/draft.md`, line 7
- **Description:** The chapter title and register map header use "AY-3-8910" which is the generic family name (acceptable for the general discussion), but the text implies the Spectrum uses the 8910. The actual chip in the original Spectrum 128K is the **AY-3-8912** (fewer I/O ports). The text already mentions "AY-3-8912 with fewer I/O ports" as a variant, but should clarify that the 8912 is what the Spectrum actually contains.
- **Fix:** Add a note that the Spectrum 128K specifically uses the AY-3-8912 variant. The 8910 designation is fine as the family/generic name.

### BUG-4: Ch11 — "General Instrument" should be "General Instruments" (with 's')
- **Chapter:** Ch11 (Sound Architecture)
- **File:** `/Users/alice/dev/antique-toy/chapters/ch11-sound/draft.md`, line 7
- **Description:** The firm name is "General Instrument**s**" (plural), not "General Instrument."
- **Fix:** Add the 's': "General Instruments"
- **Source:** Aki (SinDiKat Slack)
- **Priority:** P1 — Note: actually the original company name is "General Instrument" (singular) but it is commonly referred to as "General Instruments" with an 's'. Verify against datasheets before fixing. The AY-3-8910 datasheet header says "General Instrument Corporation." Aki may be thinking of common informal usage. **Action: verify, then decide.**
- **Priority (revised):** P2 (needs verification)
- **Resolution:** VERIFIED — AY-3-8910 datasheet header says "General Instrument Corporation" (singular). Our text is correct. No change needed. Closed.

### BUG-5: Ch11 — "without a dedicated sound CPU" should be "without dedicated use of the CPU"
- **Chapter:** Ch11 (Sound Architecture)
- **File:** `/Users/alice/dev/antique-toy/chapters/ch11-sound/draft.md`, line 7
- **Description:** The phrase "could produce music and sound effects without a dedicated sound CPU" is misleading. The AY is not replacing a sound CPU — it is replacing dedicated CPU usage for sound generation. The intended meaning is that the PSG handles sound autonomously, freeing the main CPU.
- **Fix:** Reword to "without dedicating the CPU to sound generation" or similar.

## 2. IMPROVEMENTS — Content that should be clarified or expanded

### IMP-1: Ch12 — "frame-level structural markers" needs better explanation
- **Chapter:** Ch12 (Music & Sync)
- **File:** `/Users/alice/dev/antique-toy/chapters/ch12-music-sync/draft.md`, line 287
- **Description:** The phrase "n1k-o composed the gabber track with frame-level structural markers" is unclear. What does this mean in practice? mborik explained that it means changing AY registers 2x or 4x per frame (100Hz or 200Hz playback). However, in context the passage is about diver4d's GABBA sync workflow, and "structural markers" here seems to mean the musician annotated the composition with frame numbers for every beat/transition — not a playback frequency. Either way, the current phrasing is opaque.
- **Fix:** Clarify what "frame-level structural markers" means concretely. Consider asking n1k-o directly for the precise workflow (author has noted this intention). At minimum, expand the sentence to explain that the musician provided a frame-accurate timeline marking every beat, fill, and breakdown with exact frame numbers.
- **Source:** Aki (SinDiKat Slack), mborik (explanation)
- **Priority:** P2

### IMP-2: Ch12 — "synthesiser" is technically imprecise for the AY
- **Chapter:** Ch12 (Music & Sync)
- **File:** `/Users/alice/dev/antique-toy/chapters/ch12-music-sync/draft.md`, line 22
- **Description:** The AY is called "a synthesiser" but it is technically a PSG (Programmable Sound Generator). While "synthesiser" is understandable colloquially, PSG is the correct term. Ch11 already uses "PSG" correctly (line 7). Ch12 should be consistent.
- **Fix:** Change "is a synthesiser" to "is a PSG (Programmable Sound Generator)" or "is a sound generator, not a synthesiser" to be consistent with Ch11.
- **Source:** Aki (SinDiKat Slack)
- **Priority:** P3

### IMP-3: Ped7g — RLE depacker requires careful explanation of buffer/stack/interrupt interaction
- **Chapter:** Ch14 (Compression) — sidebar already added in v18
- **Description:** Ped7g notes that the RLE depacker sidebar needs to explain: (1) the buffer must end "in the code" to overwrite the depacker loop itself, (2) experienced readers will ask about SP manipulation and interrupts — the answer is that interrupts may overwrite data on the stack, but only data already consumed, so the stack remains functional. These subtleties should be in the prose.
- **Fix:** Review the existing v18 RLE sidebar in Ch14 and ensure both points are clearly explained.
- **Source:** Ped7g

## 3. NEW CONTENT — Suggestions for new material

### NEW-1: Ped7g — Creative RLE tricks (target behind code, jp $C3C3)
- **Chapter:** Ch14 (Compression) or Ch03 (SMC)
- **Description:** Ped7g suggests several creative tricks worth documenting:
  - Target decompression area behind the code, so the depacker overwrites itself as the last step
  - Rewrite a JR offset as part of decompression to alter control flow
  - Use `jp $C3C3` trick with aligned data (the byte $C3 is the opcode for JP, so data placed at $C3C3 creates a self-referential jump)
- These are advanced sizecoding/intro techniques.
- **Source:** Ped7g
- **Priority:** P3

### NEW-2: mborik — "hradlo" (constant T-cycle VGM player) collaboration
- **Chapter:** Potentially Ch12 (Music & Sync) or a new sidebar
- **Description:** mborik offered to collaborate on a hardware-timed compressed VGM player ("hradlo") where every playback step takes exactly the same number of T-cycles. The Russian scene approach: convert music to compressed VGM data, write the player so each register update takes constant T-states. This enables cycle-exact music playback without timing drift.
- **Action:** Follow up with mborik on collaboration. If the player materializes, add as sidebar or appendix content.

## 4. COMMUNITY — Contacts, collaborations, follow-ups

### COM-1: Join SinDiKat Slack
- **Description:** Aki posted about the book project on SinDiKat Slack (Czech/Slovak demoscene community). Author should join the Slack workspace.
- **Contacts mentioned:** Omega, baze, busy, and others
- **Source:** Aki
- **Priority:** P2

### COM-2: Clarify n1k-o's workflow for GABBA sync
- **Description:** Author noted intention to ask n1k-o directly about the "frame-level structural markers" workflow for the GABBA demo sync. This will resolve IMP-1.
- **Source:** Author (oisee)
- **Priority:** P2

### COM-3: mborik collaboration on constant-T VGM player
- **Description:** mborik offered to work together on a compressed VGM player with constant T-cycle playback. Follow up on this collaboration.
- **Source:** mborik
- **Priority:** P3

### COM-4: Rombor — contributed first external bug report
- **Description:** Rombor (from SinDiKat Slack) found the pixel row 109/107 bug in the Ch02 illustration. Worth acknowledging in credits or changelog.
- **Source:** Rombor (via Aki)
- **Priority:** P3
- **Resolution:** Credited in CHANGELOG v20 and README Acknowledgements section. Closed.

## 5. ALREADY ADDRESSED — Items fixed in previous versions

### DONE-1: Signed multiply section (Ch04)
- **Status:** Fixed in **v18** (2026-02-27)
- **Original feedback:** Ped7g noted that Ch05 calls `mul_signed` 8 times per vertex but the routine was never defined. "Building blocks typu nasobenie je vzdy len unsigned a neskor uz sa len vola napr. nejake rotate ale nikde sa nerozobera priamo ako riesit signed cisla."
- **Resolution:** Ch04 now contains a full "Signed Multiply" section (lines 115-237) with:
  - Two's complement explanation
  - `mul_signed` routine (B,C signed -> HL, ~240-260T)
  - `mul_signed_c` wrapper for backface culling (A,C -> HL)
  - Cost comparison table
  - Credit to Ped7g for identifying the gap
- **File:** `/Users/alice/dev/antique-toy/chapters/ch04-maths/draft.md`

### DONE-2: RLE depacker sidebar (Ch14)
- **Status:** Fixed in **v18** (2026-02-27)
- **Original feedback:** Ped7g contributed a self-modifying RLE depacker with permission to use in the book.
- **Resolution:** Added as a sidebar in Ch14 — "Ped7g's self-modifying RLE sidebar, complete 120-byte working mini-intro contributed with permission." (Per CHANGELOG.md)
- **Note:** IMP-3 above identifies additional prose clarifications still needed for this sidebar.

Prepared explanation of Chrome extension capabilities

Yes! I have access to Chrome via the "Claude in Chrome" extension. Here's what I can do:

Browsing & Search: I can navigate to URLs, search the web, read page content, interact with elements (click, type, scroll), and extract text from pages.

File Downloads: This one comes with caveats — I can initiate downloads, but every download requires your explicit confirmation first (I'll tell you the filename, size, and source before proceeding). I can't just silently download things.

Other capabilities: Fill forms, take screenshots, read console/network logs, execute JavaScript on pages, and even record GIFs of browser sessions.

So in practice, I could do things like navigate to a site, find a specific file or resource, and then download it with your approval. Want to try something?

can you follow these "manual steps"? and discover great articles on z80/zx spectrum extreme optimization coding?

Assessed feasibility of extracting Z80 optimization resources from various online sources
Assessed feasibility of extracting Z80 optimization resources from various online sources







Great project, Alice! Let me assess what I can realistically tackle here. Some of these are within reach, others not so much.

What I can try via Chrome:

B1–B6, C1–C3: Navigate to Hype articles and extract full text
E1–E2: Read Pouet comment threads
F1–F4: Search for additional sources (GitHub repos, author profiles)
What I likely can't do:

A1–A3: scene.org/retroscene.org ZIP downloads — these domains may block or be inaccessible
D1–D5: TRD disk images require a ZX Spectrum emulator — completely out of scope for a browser
Let me start with the highest-value items — the critical Hype articles. I'll present a plan first:


Pivoted to alternative methods for extracting optimization coding resources
Pivoted to alternative methods for extracting optimization coding resources


Hmm, looks like the Chrome extension isn't currently connected to a browser. But I can still try using web_fetch to grab these pages directly. Let me start with the critical ones:


Procured technical article and strategized retrieving additional resources
Procured technical article and strategized retrieving additional resources


Got B1 — full article + comments! That's the critical Illusion technical breakdown by Introspec with all the inner loop analysis and the fantastic comment thread. Let me save this and continue with the others.


Orchestrated efficient batch retrieval of optimization articles
Orchestrated efficient batch retrieval of optimization articles


Got B2 — the full "Making of Eager" with all 40 comments! This is a treasure trove — digital drums over AY, chaos zoomer inner loops, async frame generation. Let me continue with the remaining articles. I'll fetch them in parallel:


Catalogued optimization resources and organized remaining research materials
Catalogued optimization resources and organized remaining research materials


Got B3 — "Код мёртв" with comments. Now let me save everything collected so far and continue fetching the remaining items. Let me get the rest of the Hype articles and the Pouet pages:


Consolidated gathered content and strategized file organization
Consolidated gathered content and strategized file organization



Excellent — got B4 as well! I'm hitting context limits on the raw HTML though. Let me now save the critical articles I've successfully retrieved as clean text files, then continue with the remaining items.


Navigated domain restrictions while strategizing content retrieval approach
Navigated domain restrictions while strategizing content retrieval approach









Actually, the container can only reach whitelisted domains — hype.retroscene.org isn't one of them. But web_fetch can! Let me continue fetching the remaining articles that way, then save everything to files.


Assessed content retrieval limitations and strategized compilation approach
Assessed content retrieval limitations and strategized compilation approach





I'm hitting token limits on the sidebar-heavy pages. Let me take stock and compile what I've successfully retrieved into a status report. The key articles (B1 and B2) came through in full — those are the most critical ones.


Prepared to synthesize Z80 optimization resources comprehensively
Prepared to synthesize Z80 optimization resources comprehensively


Here's the status. The big wins from this session:

Fully retrieved (in this conversation's context):

B1 — Illusion technical breakdown — the crown jewel. Full inner loop analysis with Z80 code, T-state math, all 116 comments including the incredible kotsoft/introspec debate about precalculation, Raider's sin-table "commandments", and the map projection discussion
B2 — Making of Eager — complete making-of with async frame engine details, chaos zoomer ld hl,nn : ldi technique, digital drums architecture, and kernel scripting code
B3 — Код мёртв — the pop hl : ldd essay in full
B4 — За дизайн — design-first manifesto
What I can't do:

A1–A3 (ZIP downloads from scene.org) — domain blocked
D1–D5 (TRD disk images) — needs an actual ZX emulator
Chrome extension wasn't connected, which would have helped with cleaner page extraction
What I can still do in a follow-up turn: C1–C3 (the partially-extracted dev articles), E1–E2 (Pouet), and B5–B6. Want me to continue, or would you prefer to upload these massive B1/B2 texts to your book workspace first?

Chrome is connected — and you've already got C3 (Tiles & RET) open! Let me extract it and then work through the remaining pages.


Preserved content and pivoted toward next section
Preserved content and pivoted toward next section


Got C3 in full! Now let me work through the remaining pages. Let me navigate to C1 (Chunky effects by sq):


Recalibrated URL path to access correct resource
Recalibrated URL path to access correct resource




That redirected to a different page. The URL path might differ. Let me try the correct one:


Investigated redirect issue and devised JavaScript workaround

The site seems to strip the /dev/ prefix. Let me try using JavaScript to force the URL:


Investigated URL redirection inconsistencies and searched for alternative article location
Investigated URL redirection inconsistencies and searched for alternative article location


The site redirects that URL. Let me search for the chunky article directly:


Used Claude in Chrome integration, searched the web

Let me search within Hype for the chunky article:


Strategized alternative search methods and resource locations
Strategized alternative search methods and resource locations










Let me try the Hype dev blog listing directly and search for the article there, and meanwhile use the other tab for Pouet:


Navigated through pages seeking recent article content
Navigated through pages seeking recent article content






The chunky article (2022) would be on page 1. Let me check:


Investigated loading issues and pivoted toward alternative resources
Investigated loading issues and pivoted toward alternative resources











The chunky article (C1) URL seems broken on the site. Let me move on to what I can get — C2 (Hara Mamba), B5 (MORE), and the Pouet pages:


Gathered technical resources and prepared navigation tasks
Gathered technical resources and prepared navigation tasks







C2 extracted in full with all Z80 code! Now let me get B5 and the Pouet pages:


Orchestrated navigation through multiple interface sections sequentially
Orchestrated navigation through multiple interface sections sequentially






Got B5! Now the Pouet pages:


Navigated permission constraints and explored alternative information sources

Pouet isn't in the approved domains. Let me use web_fetch for those:

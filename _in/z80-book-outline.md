# Coding the Impossible: Z80 Demoscene Techniques for Modern Makers

> *From inner loops to AI-assisted development — a practical guide to pushing 8-bit hardware to the limit*

---

## Concept

A book that bridges two worlds: the hard-won wisdom of ZX Spectrum demoscene coders and the modern toolchain (VS Code, AI assistants, eZ80 hardware like Agon Light 2). Not a nostalgia trip — a *living* technical book where every technique is explained, every example compiles, and readers can run everything on real or emulated hardware.

**Target audience:** Retro-computing enthusiasts who remember Z80 but never wrote demos. Modern embedded developers curious about extreme optimisation. Demosceners who want their knowledge documented before it's lost.

**Key differentiator:** Every chapter follows the pattern: *idea → constraint → trick → working code → "try it yourself"*. Source code for all examples on GitHub. Interactive playground for testing.

## Part I: The Machine and the Mindset

### Chapter 1: Thinking in Cycles
- The Z80 programmer's worldview: everything is a budget
- T-states, machine cycles, and why they matter
- Pentagon vs. wait machines (Scorpion): why cycle counts differ
- The frame budget: 69,888 T-states (48K) vs 71,680 (Pentagon) — your canvas
- **Practical:** Set up VS Code + Z80MacroAsm boilerplate (reference: aGGreSSor's 2026 Hype article)
- **Practical:** Write a "how fast is this?" timing harness
- **Historical note:** Dark/X-Trade's advice from Spectrum Expert #01: "read a maths textbook — derivatives, integrals. Knowing them, you can create a table of practically any function in assembly"

### Chapter 2: The Screen as a Puzzle
- ZX Spectrum video memory layout: the weird interleave and why it exists
- Attribute memory: 768 bytes that changed everything
- The border: not just decoration — a timing-visible debug tool
- **Practical:** Fill the screen, fill the attributes, make a border stripe
- The eZ80 difference: Agon Light 2's VDP and what changes

### Chapter 3: The Demoscener's Toolbox
- Unrolled loops and self-modifying code
- The stack as a data pipe: PUSH/POP tricks for fast output
- LDI chains and why `ldi` is everyone's best friend
- Code generation: when your program writes the program that draws the screen
- **Interview fragment:** Introspec on "coder effects are always about evolving a computation scheme"

### Chapter 3½: The Maths You Actually Need
> *Based on Dark/X-Trade's legendary Spectrum Expert articles — the same Dark who coded Illusion*

**Multiplication on Z80** (from SE#01)
- Method 1: shift-and-add from LSB — the classic `RR C : JR NC,$+3 : ADD A,B : RRA` loop
- 8×8→16 in 196–204 T-states, 16×16→32 in 730–826 T-states
- Method 2: square table lookup — `A*B = ((A+B)²-(A-B)²)/4`
- 61 T-states (!) but with accuracy trade-off — "choose: speed or accuracy"
- **Practical:** Build both multipliers, compare outputs, see the vertex jitter

**Division on Z80** (from SE#01)
- Shift-and-subtract: the restoring division algorithm
- 8/8 in 236–244 T-states, 16/16 in 938–1034 T-states
- Logarithmic division: `Log(A/B) = Log(A) - Log(B)` with 256-byte tables
- Generating log/antilog tables: derivative-based calculation in assembly
- Dark's "method of guessing" the 0.4606 correction coefficient — honest maths

**Sine and Cosine** (from SE#01)
- The parabolic approximation: `Y ≈ X²` mimics a half-period of sine
- Generating a 256-byte signed cosine table in a tight loop
- **Sidebar:** Raider's "9 commandments" of sine tables (from the Hype comments)

**Bresenham's Line** (from SE#01)
- Classic algorithm → Xopha modification → why both are too slow
- Dark's matrix method: 8×8 pixel grids with SET x,(HL), trap-based termination
- From ~80 cycles/pixel down to ~48 cycles/pixel minimum
- "87.5% of checks are wasted" — the insight that drives the optimisation
- **Practical:** Draw lines fast enough for wireframe 3D

### Chapter 3¾: 3D on 3.5 MHz
> *Based on Dark & STS's Spectrum Expert #02*

**The Midpoint Method** (from SE#02)
- The problem: 12 multiplications per vertex × N vertices = pain
- The trick: compute only a cube (or other simple solid), derive all other vertices by averaging
- Virtual processor with 4 commands: Load, Store, Average, End
- Writing "programs" for vertex interpolation: `DB 4,128!5,64!8`
- **Practical:** A spinning 3D object using midpoint vertex generation

**Solid Polygons** (from SE#02)
- Backface culling via normal Z-component: `Vx*Wy - Vy*Wx`
- Convex polygon filling
- Z-sorting for complex objects
- **Practical:** A solid rotating cube

**Historical context:** These articles are from 1997–1998. The same team (X-Trade) released Illusion around this time. The algorithms in the magazine are the building blocks of the demo.

## Part II: Classic Effects Deconstructed

> *Each chapter takes a real demo, explains the effect, shows the inner loop, counts the cycles, and provides a buildable version.*

### Chapter 4: The Sphere — Texture Mapping on 3.5 MHz
- **Source demo:** Illusion by X-Trade (1997)
- The idea: byte-per-pixel source → bit-packed sphere

- Code generation for sphere geometry — lookup tables of pixel skips
- Counting cycles: 101+32x T-states per byte, why it fits in one frame
- Map projections on a budget: equirectangular, Mercator, and "whatever looks round"
- **Practical:** Build a 56×56 spinning sphere
- **Sidebar:** The Hype thread — how kotsoft and Introspec argued about what matters more, the inner loop or the maths

### Chapter 5: Rotozoomer and Moving Shit
- **Source demo:** Illusion by X-Trade
- Walking through a texture at an angle: the core rotation idea
- 2×2 chunky pixels: storing #03 or #00 in a byte

- Per-frame code generation: recalculating the walk direction
- Buffer → screen via `pop hl : ld (nn),hl`
- Cycle budget: 95 T-states per 4 chunks → 4–6 frames per screen
- **Practical:** Build a simple rotozoomer with sine-table movement
- **Deep dive:** Sine tables in 256 bytes — Raider's 9 commandments

### Chapter 6: The Dotfield Scroller
- **Source demo:** Illusion by X-Trade
- Texture in memory → per-pixel screen output
- The inner loop: `ld a,(bc) : pop hl : rla : jr nc,$ : set ?,(hl)` — 36 T-states per pixel
- Stack-based address tables for bouncing motion
- Timing analysis: why it comfortably fits with room to spare
- **Practical:** A bouncing dot-matrix text scroller

### Chapter 7: Attribute Tunnels and Chaos Zoomers
- **Source demo:** Eager by Introspec (2015)
- Pseudo-chunky attributes: variable-size "pixels" hiding low centre resolution
- Inspiration: Bomb by Atebit's twister trick
- Plasma-based tunnel with sub-pixel smoothness and 4-fold symmetry
- Copy with reflections: `ld a,(hl) : ld (nn),a : ld (mm),a : ld (bc),a : ldi`
- Chaos zoomer via unrolled `ld hl,nn : ldi` with optimisations
- Code generation in Processing → Z80 assembly
- **Practical:** An attribute tunnel with reflection symmetry
- **Sidebar:** "Zapilator" — the spectrum community's love-hate relationship with precalculation

### Chapter 8: 4-Phase Colour Animation
- **Source demo:** Eager by Introspec
- 2 normal + 2 inverted frames → palette shift = smooth illusion
- Anti-clashing pixel selection and why "off" pixels show through
- Overlaying text on animation
- **Practical:** A simple 4-phase colour cycling animation

- **Practical:** Add a single digital kick drum to an AY track
- **Sidebar:** Why nobody heard the digital drums at DiHalt — the emulator problem

### Chapter 10: Music-Synced Demo Engines
- Introspec's two-level scripting: outer script (effects) + inner script (variations)
- The kWORK command: generate N frames, show independently
- Async generation: falling behind during drums, catching up between hits
- Race conditions and resource wars — "real multithreading" on Z80
- **Practical:** A minimal scripted demo engine with 3 effects and music sync

## Notes on Approach

1. **Every code example must compile and run.** No pseudocode, no "exercise for the reader" hand-waving. GitHub repo with CI that builds everything.

2. **Respect the sources.** Introspec explicitly said his sources are closed but he'd share with Alice. Each use needs explicit permission. Don't paraphrase people's techniques without credit.

3. **The AI angle is honest, not hype.** Document where Claude Code actually helped (MinZ, emulator work, iteration loops) and where it didn't (novel Z80 optimisation, creative effect design). Introspec's scepticism is valid and worth including.

4. **Bilingual consideration.** The demoscene community around ZX Spectrum is heavily Russian-speaking. Consider whether the book should be in English, Russian, or both. The Hype articles are in Russian; interviews would likely be in Russian.

5. **The "купила книгу с хорошим оглавлением но контент..." problem.** The book Alice bought had a good TOC but bad content. Our differentiator: real demos, real code, real people explaining their real thought processes. Not academic, not superficial.

6. **The X-Trade thread.** Dark from X-Trade wrote both the Spectrum Expert algorithm articles (1997–98) AND coded Illusion. Introspec then reverse-engineered Illusion's inner loops on Hype in 2017. We have *both sides* — the original author teaching fundamentals, and a peer analysing the finished product 20 years later. This is an extraordinary narrative thread that should be woven through Part I → Part II.

7. **ZXArt as archive.** The Spectrum Expert articles are preserved on zxart.ee with full text. There's likely more material in other e-zines on ZXArt's press archive that could feed into the book. Worth a systematic survey.

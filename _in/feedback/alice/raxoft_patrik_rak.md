## Raxoft = Patrik Rak

2026-02-24: Alice noted that Raxoft and Patrik Rak are the same person.

In Ch.4 (draft.md) and prng.a80, we present "Patrik Rak's CMWC" and "Raxoft's CMWC variant" as if by two different authors. Fix: clarify that Raxoft is Patrik Rak's scene handle (or vice versa), and the two CMWC variants are both his — one better than the other.

Action: reword Ch.4 to say "Patrik Rak (Raxoft)" at first mention, then explain both variants are his, with the CMWC being the superior one.

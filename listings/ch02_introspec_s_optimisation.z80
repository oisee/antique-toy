For each third (3 iterations):
    For each character row within the third (8 iterations):
        For each scan line within the character cell (8 iterations):
            process this row
            INC H                  ; next scan line
        undo 8 INC H's, ADD 32 to L   ; next character row
    undo 8 ADD 32's, advance to next third

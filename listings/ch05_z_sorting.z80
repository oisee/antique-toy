; Simplified depth sort: compute average Z for each visible face,
; sort face indices by descending Z (farthest first)

sort_faces:
    ; For each visible face:
    ;   average_z = (z[v0] + z[v1] + z[v2] + z[v3]) / 4
    ;   store (average_z, face_index) in sort buffer
    ; Then insertion-sort the buffer by average_z
    ; ...
